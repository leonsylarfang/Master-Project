subtitle : Report of Implementation on ODE-based C2 Continuous Surface Creation Technique
summary:  This project implements the ODE-based C2 continuous surface creation technique to recreate two models in the same topology with different expressions. Besides, it blends the surface creation method with geometric and physics-based skin deformation approaches to show,
(1)the advantages of the ODE-based surface creation technique,(2)the more realistic result of physics-based skin deformation approach,(3)the feasibility of blending this two approaches together.
